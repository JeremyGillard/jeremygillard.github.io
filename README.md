# Personal Portfolio

This site will be my personal technical portfolio.

The idea will be to have a page without scroll with animation to introduce myself briefly. 
On this page will be 2 links to my github and my linkedin and 4 buttons leading to the following pages:
path, projects, skills, notes (blog)

## Path

This page will be presented as a timeline (animated downwards using scroll).

## Projects

This page will contain links to possible pro projects and links to the repos of my personal projects on github (api github).

## Skills

This page will gather in an exhaustive way the acquired technical skills that I wish to put forward (possibly set up a tagging system linked to my github and pro projects).

## Notes

This page will contain all the articles I plan to write as public personal notes. (It will also allow me to practice my English writing skills).
