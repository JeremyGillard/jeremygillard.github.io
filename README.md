# Personal Portfolio

This site will be my personal technical portfolio.

The idea will be to have a page without scroll with animation to introduce myself briefly. 
On this page will be 2 links to my github and my linkedin and 4 buttons leading to the following pages:
path, projects, skills, notes (blog)
