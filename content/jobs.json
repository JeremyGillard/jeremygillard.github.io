I have, therefore, today, an even more precise idea of the fields in which I would like to evolve later. I would like to improve my knowledge and experience in web or low level development, devops and/or cloud and cyber security. If you think you have an opportunity that matches my aspirations, please feel free to contact me.",

            "description": "I was lucky enough to work on a Europe-wide research project at the Ecole Polytechnique de Lille. This project, named CoBra, aims to improve quality of both diagnosis and treatment of localized cancers, by developing a new medical robot prototype for brachytherapy and biopsy under guidance of MRI. During this internship, I developed a series of tools (Python scripts) to make present and future data from the lab more easily accessible. This allowed me to accelerate the analysis process of MRI images as well as their manipulation and sorting for future image processing or machine learning algorithms. At the same time, I first tried to verify that a more classical treatment approach could not be applied to the present project. I then turned to a more recent approach of machine learning and more precisely in deep learning. I was then able to make some initial explorations in order to be able to guide the team for their future software developments.",
